## MERN Training Demo App

Products portal where users can login, create products and filter them on price-range.

1. Starts with very basic use of react without any build tools
1. Uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) with basic handmade easy-to-explain config.
1. The portal interacts with APIs of nodejs app built in the [node training](https://github.com/tejasbubane/nodejs-training).

### Requirements:

1. Newer version of NodeJS installed. `v8+` should work.
